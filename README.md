Introduction
=========
The STM Android sensor Hardware Abstraction Layer (*HAL*) defines a standard interface for STM sensors allowing Android to be agnostic about [lower-level driver implementations](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STMems_Linux_Input_drivers/tree/linux-3.10.y-gh) . The HAL library is packaged into modules (.so) file and loaded by the Android system at the appropriate time. For more information see [AOSP HAL Interface](https://source.android.com/devices/sensors/hal-interface.html) 

STM Sensor HAL is leaning on [Linux Input framework](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/input) to gather data from sensor device drivers and to forward samples to the Android Framework

Currently supported sensors are:

### Inertial Module Unit (IMU):

> asm330lxh, lsm330, lsm330dlc, lsm6ds0,  lsm6ds3, lsm6dsm, lsm6dsl, lsm9ds0, lsm9ds1, lsm330d

### eCompass:

> lsm303agr, lsm303ah, lsm303c, lsm303d, lsm303dlhc

### Accelerometer:

> ais328dq, lis2de, lis2dh12, lis2ds12, lis2hh12, lis3dh

### Gyroscope:

> a3g4250d, l3gd20, l3gd20h

### Magnetometer:

> lis3mdl

### Pressure and Temperature:

> lps22hb, lps25h

### Humidity and Temperature:

> hts221

Software architecture
===============
STM Sensor HAL is written in *C++* language using object-oriented design. For each hw sensor there is a custom class file (*AccelSensor.cpp*, *MagnSensor.cpp*, *GyroSensor.cpp*, *PressSensor.cpp* and *HumiditySensor.cpp*) which extends the common base class (*SensorBase.cpp*).

Configuration parameters for each device (such as the name of the sensor, default full scale, names of the sysfs files, etc.) are specified in a dedicated file placed in the *conf* directory and named *conf_<sensor_name\>.h* (e.g. *conf_LSM6DSM.h*)

Integration details
=============

Copy the HAL source code into *<AOSP_DIR\>/hardware/STMicroelectronics/SensorHAL_Input* folder. During building process Android will include automatically the SensorHAL Android.mk.
In *<AOSP_DIR\>/device/<vendor\>/<board\>/device.mk* add package build information:

	PRODUCT_PACKAGES += sensors.{TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM}

	Note: device.mk can not read $(TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM) variable, read and replace the value from your BoardConfig.mk (e.g. PRODUCT_PACKAGES += sensors.msm8974 for Nexus 5)

  The Android.mk file defines the list of all supported devices. To enable a sensor put its name (e.g. *LSM6DSM*) in the *ENABLED_SENSORS* macro:

	ENABLED_SENSORS := LSM6DSM

To compile SensorHAL_Input just build AOSP source code from *$TOP* folder

	$ cd <AOSP_DIR>
	$ source build/envsetup.sh
	$ lunch <select target platform>
	$ make V=99

The compiled library will be placed in *<AOSP_DIR\>/out/target/product/<board\>/system/vendor/lib/hw/sensor.{TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM}.so*

For more information on compiling an Android project, please consult the [AOSP website](https://source.android.com/source/requirements.html) 


STM proprietary libraries
================

STM proprietary libraries are used to define composite sensors based on hardware (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) or to provide sensor calibration

### SENSOR_FUSION:
> The STM Sensor Fusion library is a complete 9-axis/6-axis solution which combines the measurements from a 3-axis gyroscope, a 3-axis magnetometer and a 3-axis accelerometer to provide a robust absolute orientation vector and game orientation vector

### GEOMAG_FUSION:
> The STM GeoMag Fusion library is a complete 6-axis solution which combines the measurements from a 3-axis magnetometer and a 3-axis accelerometer to provide a robust geomagnetic orientation vector

### GBIAS:
> The STM Gbias Calibration library provides an efficient gyroscope bias runtime compensation

### MAGCALIB:
> The STM Magnetometer Calibration library provides an accurate magnetometer Hard Iron (HI) and Soft Iron (SI) runtime compensation

The *Android.mk* file enumerates STM libraries supported by the HAL. The *ENABLED_MODULES* variable is used to enable support for proprietary STM libraries

	ENABLED_MODULES := SENSOR_FUSION MAGCALIB GBIAS

The release of STM proprietary libraries is subject to signature of a License User Agreement (LUA); please contact an STMicroelectronics sales office and representatives for further information.
